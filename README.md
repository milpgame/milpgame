# Milpgame
Milpgame is a proof assistant and a checker (it shows a message only something gone wrong) for
 the Metamath language, also it is an open source(MIT License) Java application(cross-platform application:
Window,Linux,Mac OS).You can enter  the demonstration(proof) in two modes : forward and backward  relative
 to the statement to prove. Milpgame checks if a statement is well formed(has a syntactic verifier). 
 You can save unfinished proofs without the use of dummylink theorem. The demonstration is shown as tree, 
the statements are shown  using html definitions (defined in typesetting chapter).Milpgame is distributed as
 Java .jar(JRE version 6 update 24 written in NetBeans IDE), it can be downloaded from www.milpgame.com and in the near future 
I hope that will be available also on metamath.org site.For help and feedback you can send me e-mails 
on milpgame@yahoo.com.
